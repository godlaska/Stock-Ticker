# cse383_final

## Project Overview

The AFFC Stocks web-client is the final project of CSE383 Section A, developed by Keigen Godlaski and Ethan Varner. This dynamic platform integrates various concepts learned throughout the semester and leverages HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Ajax, and PHP to create a multifunctional web application. The project includes a landing page, 'About Us' sections, stock information pages, and user account functionalities.

The original commits and history were done in a private university GitLab, meaning this is just a copy and doesn't have the full commit history.

This README is a work-in-progress, it will be updated soon!
